<summary>Introduction üìù </summary>
<br>
The oligopolistic nature of the modern airline industry intensifies competition amongst its most dominant firms, making them interdependent on one another, and bringing about the need for strategic behaviour. As various airlines fly the same routes, product differentiation can only occur via customer experience. Hence, in such an environment, it‚Äôs crucial to maintain a high customer satisfaction (CSAT) to not only increase customer retention but to improve brand image, attracting new customers and increasing the airlines market power. Subsequently, establishing loyalty in customers enables a shift towards more inelastic prices, further increasing revenue. 

One aspect of customer experience requiring improvement is catering. Whilst the meals themselves consistently receive high feedback, the coordination of service on board is poor. Currently, cabin crew manually check which meals are on offer, and the abundance of each, creating opportunity for miscounting and miscommunication between colleagues. Too often are passengers promised meals which are out of stock, served cold food, or not had options explained clearly. 

Consequently, this project aims to develop an app that‚Äôll enable cabin crew to view and edit real-time meal inventory statuses. With stock levels available at a glance, the need to consult colleagues or rummage through trolleys is eliminated. This will empower them to offer meal choices with greater accuracy, ensuring they can uphold their commitments to passengers, and serve more people faster, boosting CSAT for the airline.

<summary>Use of Agile Methods üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è </summary>
<br>
The agile philosophy is the ability to create and respond to change. This approach was formally introduced in 2001 with the creation of the symbolic Agile Manifesto, which emphasises flexibility, collaboration and iterative progress. 

Agile techniques have been hugely successful in the software development industry, revolutionising project delivery. By fostering collaboration, adaptability and faster times-to-market, companies worldwide are experiencing enhanced productivity and customer satisfaction. This widespread adoption of the technique underscores agile‚Äôs effectiveness in driving innovation, helping companies establish a competitive edge. 

Hence, for this project, I‚Äôll be embracing the agile framework to help produce a more user-centric solution, within a culture of teamwork and continuous user feedback. Unlike the traditional waterfall approach, agile‚Äôs iterative nature ensures incremental delivery of value, providing a simple, immediate solution that‚Äôll be iteratively improved. Meanwhile, the value from a more linear approach is delayed until it‚Äôs end ‚Äì a risk that could be costly if this final product has misaligned deliverables with the stakeholders.

To implement agile principles in the project, I have utilised GitHub as a project management tool. Here, project workload is broken down into manageable tickets (issues). These issues have then been logged into sprints, providing a structured timeline for the project. By planning value delivery at the end of each sprint, I can ensure the project remains focused. Issues are also tracked via KanBan boards, providing a visual representation of task progression. In the workplace, this maintains transparency and clarity across the team, allowing bottlenecks to be clearly identified and stakeholders to remain updated on the apps progress. 

Below is an example of a retrospective carried out at the end of sprint 1.  This creates space to reflect on progress, discuss working habits and set targets for the next sprint. All of which continuously shape the team into more efficient software developers, and hence leads to the production of a more successful product.

<summary>Project Scoping Methods üßê </summary>
<br>
Design thinking is a user-centred approach to innovation that establishes effective business models by focusing on the needs of people. These methods allow developers a deep understanding to the needs and challenges their stakeholders face, sparking creative solutions in early stages of design, and resulting in a highly functional product. Adopting this approach for the meal inventory app ensures the design is supplemented by a mindset that‚Äôll constantly assess its viability. 

In particular, design thinking involves empathising with stakeholders to understand their workflows, habits and frustrations. Hence, following some user research, the image below portrays an empathy map. This collaborative visualisation articulates our target user‚Äôs (cabin crew) environment, which can be mapped to formulate the requirements of our app, and aid future decision making: 

![Meal Inventory App - Project Scoping: EMPATHY MAP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb7bc84d-9c31-4929-a737-e8bec288d5a3)
_Figure 1: An empathy map created in Miro. A link to the Miro Board can be found here:_ [View Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLyuCzXA=/?share_link_id=371914488981)

As shown, the app‚Äôs target persona manages numerous responsibilities, from ensuring safety and security to delivering exceptional customer service, all within a tight, crowded workspace. The fast-paced, noisy environment, coupled with the pressure of customer demands, could easily overwhelm crew members, complicating tasks like meal inventory tracking or communicating with colleagues. 

In the ideation phase, these pains and gains translate into key requirements for the app: it must be simple, intuitive and stress-free to use, seamlessly synchronising across devices to reduce reliance on verbal communication amongst staff. Insights from the empathy map further highlight the priority of these requirements, outlined in the diagram below: 

![Meal Inventory App - Project Scoping: PROJECT REQUIREMENTS](assets/Meal%20Inventory%20App%20-%20Project%20Scoping%20PROJECT%20REQUIREMENTS.jpeg)
_Figure 2: The functional and non-functional requirements of the project, as identified from the empathy map findings, prioritised (created in Miro). A link to the Miro Board can be found here:_ [View Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLyuCzXA=/?share_link_id=371914488981)

We can conclude the highest priority is to deliver an app with a simple inventory view, and editing functionality. Next, the focus should shift to enhancing the usability and accessibility through colour coding, visualisations and multi-language support. In the long term, the app brings potential to expand its audience to include caterers and managers in the airline, offering insights into product demand. This would enable the company to make informed decisions about supplier partnerships and meal loading quantities, better aligning onboard availability to passenger preferences. These improvements would not only minimise waste ‚Äì supporting the airline's net carbon zero sustainability goal, but also enhance customer satisfaction and retention. 

These requirements are structured using a Now, Next, Later framework, offering clear expectations, success criteria, and a roadmap for the project‚Äôs future development. This also helps shape the components of each sprint when project planning:

<summary>Designs & Prototypes üé®</summary>
<br>
Design bridges the gap between conceptual ideas and functional application. Physical models such as mock-ups and prototypes allow developers to visualise and test their ideas before building the final product. This not only facilitates valuable user feedback, but also mitigates the risk of investing extensive resources into a design that may prove unsuccessful. 
Therefore, I first took initial ideas and sketched a low-fidelity prototype. This isn‚Äôt faithful to details of the look, feel and behaviour of the app, but rather gives a high-level abstract view of the intended design, which (at this point) is subject to change: 

![Lo-fi Design](https://github.com/EllieMartin12/SE-Sum-1/blob/EllieMartin12-Prototype/LO-FI%20Design.jpg) 


_Figure 4: An initial, low fidelity sketch of the app._

As shown, the low-fi design indicates a clear, user-friendly design. Equipped with a straightforward login page, the app will then transition to an inventory tracker where meal counts are logically and visually shown. The use of colours helps differentiate between meals, enhancing usability, whilst pie charts allow data to be interpreted at a glance.

After presenting this sketch to stakeholders and receiving positive feedback, I progressed to creating a more high-fidelity wireframe using Figma (Figure 5). This tool delivers an interactive, digital prototype, enabling me to reach a high degree of precision that aligns with the functional objectives of the app. By stimulating user experience (UX), developers are provided with a clear vision of the end goal throughout the coding process, whilst stakeholders can explore and evaluate how the final product will behave and respond to their inputs, fostering a deeper understanding and stronger alignment with user expectations.

![Figma Screen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af938082-93b7-4713-8d5a-4e42110211c1)

As illustrated, multiple views have been designed to showcase the apps appearance and functionality, meeting many of the goals outlined above. 

1. The login page includes fields for the username and password, with serval variants to simulate how these text boxes will dynamically appear at different stages of the UX. Additionally, the login page features a ‚ÄúChange Language‚Äù button which, when clicked, opens a language selector pop-up, catering for the worldwide placement of cabin crew. For users encountering login difficulties, a call-to-action button directs them to a form to report issues (Figure 6).

2. Upon logging in, the dashboard provides an intuitive overview of meal inventory, aligned with common reading habits. Content is arranged in order of decreasing significance, guiding the viewers‚Äô attention towards the most critical information, and hence allowing crew to easily scan and interpret the data quickly (a key requirement for our ‚Äòon-the-go‚Äô, busy persona). E.g., key information such as date and flight number are prominently displayed at the top, allowing crew to ensure the app is up-to-date. The rest of the content includes example meal options which‚Äôll be expressed as clickable buttons to automatically subtract one from inventory. Inventory levels are then displayed in large, bold numbers, with a green-red colour scheme that visually reflects remaining quantities.

3. To enhance accessibility, the dashboard will include a colour vision deficiency (CVD) mode, activated via the ‚ÄúCVD Friendly‚Äù button. This inclusivity ensures the app is usable and effective for all users, regardless of visual impairments. 

4. Building on the low-fi design, this prototype introduces a third view, containing functionality for users to add inventory, addressing the scenario in which additional meals are loaded unexpectedly, or crew mistakenly miscount inventory. On this page, users will also be able to seamlessly switch between flights (updating the app with each shift). Finally, a feedback link at the bottom provides an avenue for crew to share their ideas, insights and criticisms, encouraging continuous improvement, and ensuring the app remains user-centric throughout its development (utilising the design thinking approach) (Figure 7).

This prototype acts as a tangible platform for testing and refining functionality, setting a solid foundation for the successful launch of the application. Without which, we risk misaligned visions, poor usability, and wasted time and costs to the company.

<summary>Building the MVP üöÄ</summary>
<br>
  
  ### What is the MVP?
  
This is the minimum viable product: the simplest version of the app possible, that‚Äôll attract users and add business value. By leveraging insights gained through the empathy and project scoping phases above, the features of the MVP could be defined. Hence, this would simply consist of a log in page (with a company-wide log in), as well as the ability to view and decrease inventory of meals on board a particular flight. In future iterations, the app will evolve to become more inclusive and insightful by scaling to more flights, storing data to be used for corporate insights, and adding additional functionality as outlined by the "Next" and "Later" sections of the framework above.

### Coding Process

Firstly, I wrote the CSS and HTML for the user-log in page. Each of these are foundational building blocks to any web app: HTML gives the structure and content of the view, whilst CSS makes the app more visually appealing by defining its style. Next, Javascript is used to make the app more dynamic and functional. Here, I added user authentication and user interaction handling (e.g., ensuring buttons are clickable and login details are processed). I chose a modular approach to ease the debugging and maintainability of the code later on: 

First, valid credentials are defined, and an event listener is added to handle the submission process, ensuring a smooth UX:
```
function setupLogin(formElement) {
  // Define valid credentials
  const validUsername = "John_Smith";
  const validPassword = "HelloBA123";

  formElement.addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
      event.preventDefault();
      console.log("Form submitted");
```

The code then trims any whitespace and logs the username and password for testing purposes:
```
/ Get user inputs, trimming any whitespace
      const username = document.getElementById("username").value.trim();
      const password = document.getElementById("password").value.trim();
      console.log("Username:", username); // Log the username input
      console.log("Password:", password); // Log the password input
```

Next, a helper function ‚ÄòvalidateCredentials‚Äô encapsulates the logic for checking the username and password against the predefined valid ones. This function returns a Boolean variable to indicate if the user entered the correct details, and an error message should it be necessary.
```
// Call the validate credentials function, along with the user inputs
      const validationResult = validateCredentials(username, password, validUsername, validPassword);
      
      // Log validation result
      console.log("Validation Result:", validationResult);
```

Error handling is a vital part of the development process to ensure clarity for the user, maintaining a user-centric approach to building the app. Hence, I used DOM manipulation to then display targeted error messages, and inform the user of a successful login:
```
// Handle validation results:
      // If valid, alert the user 'login successful' and redirect to dashboard view
      if (validationResult.isValid) {
          alert("Login successful!");
          window.location.href = "dashboard.html"; // Redirect to dashboard
      } else {
          // If invalid, show the corresponding error message
          if (validationResult.errorMessage === "Invalid username") {
              document.getElementById("usernameError").innerText = validationResult.errorMessage;
              document.getElementById("usernameError").style.display = "block";
          } else if (validationResult.errorMessage === "Invalid password") {
              document.getElementById("passwordError").innerText = validationResult.errorMessage;
              document.getElementById("passwordError").style.display = "block";
          } else {
              document.getElementById("credentialsError").innerText = validationResult.errorMessage;
              document.getElementById("credentialsError").style.display = "block";
          }
          console.log(validationResult.errorMessage); // Log error message
      }
```

![Final Log in Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f728530-d77c-47e2-8a93-fe0116352296)
_Figure 9: The Finished Log in Page For The MVP_

Once security was in place, focus shifted towards building a basic inventory tracker. Figure 10 indicates how several iterations of the interface were built. The first included several bugs such as a fixed date and lack of styling, whilst the second brought colour, better fulfilling the requirements of the app. The final version builds upon the MVP by starting to include some 'Medium' priority requirements (e.g. a feedback form and colour-changing numbers). Again, a modular approach was taken to aid readbility and foster potential collaboration. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af5b979a-1f95-493e-9291-5e3398010aee)
_Figure 10: The incremental development of the dashboard view_

Firstly, the `setCurrentDate` function ensures the current date is always displayed at the top of the page using the `toLocaleDateString()` method. 
```
function setCurrentDate(dateElement) {
    const currentDate = new Date();
    const options = { weekday: 'long', day: 'numeric', month: 'long', year: 'numeric' };
    dateElement.textContent = currentDate.toLocaleDateString('en-UK', options);
}
```

Next, an example meal inventory is hard coded: something that‚Äôll need to be made more robust when scaling to more flights. 

```
let chickenCount = 6;
let spaghettiCount = 11;
```

The `updateMealCount` function then handles user interaction when clicking on a meal, ensuring the inventory decreases by 1. If the count reaches 0, the button is then disabled via `disableButton`:
```
function updateMealCount(mealType, countElement, buttonElement) {
    let count = mealType === 'chicken' ? chickenCount : spaghettiCount;

    if (count > 0) {
        count--; // Decrement the count

        // Update the count based on the meal type
        if (mealType === 'chicken') {
            chickenCount = count;
        } else {
            spaghettiCount = count;
        }

        // Update the text content of the count element
        countElement.textContent = count;

        // Set the color based on the count
        setColourBasedOnCount(countElement, count);

        // Disable button if count reaches zero
        if (count === 0) {
            disableButton(buttonElement);
        }
    }
}

// 4. CREATE A FUNCTION TO DISABLE THE BUTTON WHEN THE MEAL COUNT REACHES ZERO
function disableButton(buttonElement) {
    buttonElement.disabled = true;
    buttonElement.style.backgroundColor = '#ccc';
    buttonElement.style.cursor = 'not-allowed';
}
```

The `setColourBasedOnCount` function then adjusts the colour of the number dyanaimcally, using a gradient from green (to indicate high inventory) to red (low inventory). These colours give users a visual cue about how many meals are left, further improving UX. 

```
function setColourBasedOnCount(countElement, count) {
    // Define thresholds
    const maxCount = 15; // Maximum count

    // Calculate the color based on the count
    const green = Math.round((count / maxCount) * 255); // Calculate green value
    const red = Math.round(((maxCount - count) / maxCount) * 255); // Calculate red value
    const orange = Math.round(((count - 5) / 5) * 255); // Calculate orange value for mid count

    // Set the color based on the thresholds
    if (count > 10) { // Green
        countElement.style.color = `rgb(0, ${green}, 0)`; // Green to yellow
    } else if (count > 5) { // Orange
        countElement.style.color = `rgb(${red}, ${orange}, 0)`; // Orange
    } else { // Red
        countElement.style.color = `rgb(${red}, 0, 0)`; // Red
    }
}
```

Finally, the `initialiseDashboard` function is used to call all functions, tieing everything together:

```
function initialiseDashboard(dateElement, chickenBtn, spaghettiBtn, chickenCountElement, spaghettiCountElement) {
    setCurrentDate(dateElement);

    // Set initial colors based on the initial counts
    setColourBasedOnCount(chickenCountElement, chickenCount);
    setColourBasedOnCount(spaghettiCountElement, spaghettiCount);

    chickenBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
        console.log('Chicken button clicked'); // Debugging log
        updateMealCount('chicken', chickenCountElement, chickenBtn);
    });
    spaghettiBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
        console.log('Spaghetti button clicked'); // Debugging log
        updateMealCount('spaghetti', spaghettiCountElement, spaghettiBtn);
    });
}
```

<summary>Testing üß™</summary>
<br>
Testing is a critical phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), serving as the backbone for delivering high-quality, reliable and maintainable applications. It ensures the app performs as intended, aliging with its functional and non-functional requirements, whilst also checking the code is of high standard, adhering to best practices. This minimises the risks of creating an inefficient app, wasting resources and harming the airline‚Äôs reputation. 

Utilising Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles using Jest enabled a more iterative and agile workflow. Hence, app development, unit test creation and refactoring formed a cycle that outputted a reliable and robust codebase, which can be smoothly scaled to house more flights in future iterations. 

Firstly, I conducted static analysis to eliminate unused variables, neaten syntax and add comments: all of which will enable the code to reach a higher degree of reusability and developer confidence. Next, I leveraged unit tests to simulate various real-world scenarios, verifying edge cases and ensuring the functionality of each page behaved as expected. By continuously running these tests, I could make incremental changes confidently, knowing existing features could remain unaffected. 

### Login Page Unit Tests

1. A simple smoke test confirms Jest is operational:

```
test("basic test", () => {
    expect(2 + 6).toBe(8);
});
```

2. The following tests validate the functionality of the login page, ensuring the credential validation function adheres to expectations. Several combinations of correct and incorrect usernames and passwords are tested to minimise future unexpected behaviour, as well as guarantee security assurance. As an airline, maintaining security is paramount to avoid malicious exploitations.

```
/* 2. TESTING POSSIBLE INPUT USERNAMES AND PASSWORDS */

// Import the function to test from index.js
const { validateCredentials } = require("./index.js");

// Test 1: Ensure that the valid username and password work
test("Valid Username & Password", () => {
    const { isValid, errorMessage } = validateCredentials("John_Smith", "HelloBA123", "John_Smith", "HelloBA123");
    expect(isValid).toBe(true);
    expect(errorMessage).toBe("");
});

// Test 3: Check an invalid password doesn't work, despite the correct username
test("Invalid Username", () => {
    const { isValid, errorMessage } = validateCredentials("wrongUsername", "HelloBA123", "John_Smith", "HelloBA123");
    expect(isValid).toBe(false);
    expect(errorMessage).toBe("Invalid Username or Password");
});

// Test 3: Check an invalid password doesn't work, despite the correct username
test("Invalid Password", () => {
    const { isValid, errorMessage } = validateCredentials("John_Smith", "wrongPassword", "John_Smith", "HelloBA123");
    expect(isValid).toBe(false);
    expect(errorMessage).toBe("Invalid Username or Password");
});

// Test 4: Ensure that the credential validation is case sensitive
test("Lower Case Credentials", () => {
    const { isValid, errorMessage } = validateCredentials("john_smith", "HelloBA123", "John_Smith", "HelloBA123");
    expect(isValid).toBe(false);
    expect(errorMessage).toBe("Invalid Username or Password");
});
```

### Dashboard Page Unit Tests

1. Another smoke test:
```
   test("basic test", () => {
    expect(2 + 6).toBe(8);
});
```

2. This test validates the `setCurrentDate` function. An accurate, well displayed date boosts UX, installing trust in app data.
```
test("Correct Date Displayed", () => {
        // Create a mock element for the date
        const mockDateElement = { textContent: "" };
        // Call the function with the mocked element
        setCurrentDate(mockDateElement);

        // Get today's date in the expected format
        const currentDate = new Date();
        const options = { weekday: 'long', day: 'numeric', month: 'long', year: 'numeric' };
        const expectedDate = currentDate.toLocaleDateString('en-UK', options);

        // Validate if the date was returned correctly
        expect(mockDateElement.textContent).toBe(expectedDate);
    });
```

 3. Validate `updateMealCount` function, which dynamically manages meal inventory. Here, I check the meal count decreases each time the functions triggered (when the button is clicked). It also checks the button is only disabled when count reaches 0, and that colours correctly change to grant visual feedback to users. 

```
test("Update Meal Count - Chicken", () => {
        // Mock elements for count and button
        const mockCountElement = { 
            textContent: "6", 
            style: {} // Add a style object here
        };
        const mockButtonElement = {
