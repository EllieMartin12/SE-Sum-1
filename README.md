# Software Engineering Summative 1: The Development of an Inflight Meal Inventory Tracking App.

## Introduction
The oligopolistic nature of the modern airline industry intensifies competition amongst its most dominant firms, making them interdependent on one another, and bringing about the need for strategic behaviour. As various airlines fly the same routes, product differentiation can only occur via customer experience. Hence, in such an environment, it’s crucial to maintain a high customer satisfaction (CSAT) to not only increase customer retention but to improve brand image, attracting new customers and increasing the airlines market power. Subsequently, establishing loyalty in customers enables a shift towards more inelastic prices, further increasing revenue (Siegert and Ulbricht, 2020). 

One aspect of customer experience requiring improvement is catering. Whilst the meals themselves consistently receive high feedback, the coordination of serving meals on board is poor. Currently, cabin crew manually check which meals are on offer, and the abundance of each, creating opportunity for miscounting, miscommunication between colleagues and more. Too often are passengers promised meals which are out of stock, served cold food, or not had options explained clearly. 

Consequently, this project aims to develop an app that’ll enable cabin crew to view and edit real-time meal inventory statuses. With a stock level available at a glance, the need to consult colleagues or rummage through trolleys is eliminated. This will empower them to offer meal choices with greater accuracy, ensuring they can uphold more commitments to passengers, and serve more people faster, boosting CSAT.
