# Software Engineering Summative 1: The Development of an Inflight Meal Inventory Tracking App.

## Introduction
The oligopolistic nature of the modern airline industry intensifies competition amongst its most dominant firms, making them interdependent on one another, and bringing about the need for strategic behaviour. As various airlines fly the same routes, product differentiation can only occur via customer experience. Hence, in such an environment, it’s crucial to maintain a high customer satisfaction (CSAT) to not only increase customer retention but to improve brand image, attracting new customers and increasing the airlines market power. Subsequently, establishing loyalty in customers enables a shift towards more inelastic prices, further increasing revenue (Siegert and Ulbricht, 2020). 

One aspect of customer experience requiring improvement is catering. Whilst the meals themselves consistently receive high feedback, the coordination of service on board is poor. Currently, cabin crew manually check which meals are on offer, and the abundance of each, creating opportunity for miscounting and miscommunication between colleagues. Too often are passengers promised meals which are out of stock, served cold food, or not had options explained clearly. 

Consequently, this project aims to develop an app that’ll enable cabin crew to view and edit real-time meal inventory statuses. With stock levels available at a glance, the need to consult colleagues or rummage through trolleys is eliminated. This will empower them to offer meal choices with greater accuracy, ensuring they can uphold their commitments to passengers, and serve more people faster, boosting CSAT for the airline. 

## Use of Agile Methods
The agile philosophy is the ability to create and respond to change. This approach was formally introduced in 2001 with the creation of the symbolic Agile Manifesto, which emphasises flexibility, collaboration and iterative progress (Highsmith, 2002). 

Agile techniques have been hugely successful in the software development industry, revolutionising project delivery. By fostering collaboration, adaptability and faster times-to-market, companies worldwide are experiencing enhanced productivity and customer satisfaction. This widespread adoption of the technique underscores agile’s effectiveness in driving innovation, helping companies establish a competitive edge (Hooda, et al., 2023). 

Hence, for this project, I’ll be embracing the agile framework to help produce a more user-centric solution, within a culture of teamwork and continuous user feedback. Unlike the traditional waterfall approach, agile’s iterative nature ensures incremental delivery of value, providing a simple, immediate solution that’ll be iteratively improved. Meanwhile, the value from a more linear approach is delayed until it’s end – a risk that could be costly if this final product has misaligned deliverables with the stakeholders (Mokhtar and Khayyat, 2022). 
To implement agile principles in the project, I have utilised GitHub as a project management tool. Here, project workload is broken down into manageable tasks called issues, which can be assigned to and viewed by all team members. These issues have then been logged into sprints, providing a structured timeline for the project. By planning value delivery at the end of each sprint, I can ensure the project remains focused. Issues are also tracked via KanBan boards, providing a visual representation of task progression. This maintains transparency and clarity across the team, allowing bottlenecks to be clearly identified and stakeholders to remain updated on the apps progress (Ashmore and Runyan, 2014). 

Below is an example of a retrospective carried out at the end of sprint 1.  This creates space to reflect on progress, discuss working habits and set targets for the next sprint. All of which continuously shape the team into more efficient software developers, and hence leads to the production of a more successful product (Derby, Larsen and Horowitz, 2024). 

## Project Scoping Methods
Design thinking is a user-centred approach to innovation that establishes effective business models by focusing on the needs of people. These methods allow developers a deep understanding to the needs and challenges their stakeholders face, sparking creative solutions in early stages of design, and resulting in a highly functional product. Adopting this approach for the meal inventory app ensures the design is supplemented by a mindset that’ll constantly assess its viability (Mueller-Roterberg, 2020). 

In particular, design thinking involves empathising with stakeholders to understand their workflows, habits and frustrations. Hence, following some user research, the image below portrays an empathy map. This collaborative visualisation articulates our target user’s (cabin crew) environment, which can be mapped to formulate the requirements of our app, and aid future decision making:
